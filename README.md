In this repository are various scripts that I have written to maintain the macOS Operating System from a client perspective.


## Configuration Scripts ##

Description:  Scripts in this directory are scripts for configurations a system to a 'desired state.'  Currently they are older scripts that I used in DeployStudio and for enrolling unmanaged machines that were deployed before I setup a MDM solution and management infrastructure for the client.
