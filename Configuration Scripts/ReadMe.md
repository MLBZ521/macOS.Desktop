Configuration Scripts
======

Scripts in this directory are scripts for configurations a system to a 'desired state.'  Currently they are older scripts that I used in DeployStudio and for enrolling unmanaged machines that were deployed before I setup a MDM solution and management infrastructure for the client.


#### config_Staff.sh ####

Description:  This is an configuration script to configure existing Macs in the environment.


#### ds_DeploymentScript_Staff.sh ####

Description:  This script is used in Deployment Studio to configure new Macs.


#### enroll_Existing.sh ####

Description:  This script installs the MDM Profiles to enroll existing OS X devices.
